## üìù Preliminary Plan

<blockquote>
Having defined the business problem and drafted the design specifications tailored to these requirements, the following plan outlines the remaining stages in the development process, with the aim to deliver a robust and user-centered final product.   
</blockquote>

- **Develop the Data Manager**: Clean and organize the data so that it is accessible and usable.  
- **Build the Recommendation Engine**: Develop the recommendation system using content/collaborative filtering.
- **Design the Visualization Manager**: Create interactive visualization dashboards from EDA. 
- **Integrate Components**: Combine all components together into one system.  
- **User Interface Development**: Design a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the application.      
- **Testing and Iteration**: Conduct tests on the code to verify that it meets the defined requirements and make adjustments accordingly.   
- **Documentation and Training**: Create end-user documentation to help users  understand how to use the tool.    
- **Launch and Monitor**: Make the tool available to users (deploy the software to production environment); maintain and update the tool if needed.
