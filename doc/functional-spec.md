## 📊 Data Source

### Spotify Dataset (Content Filtering)

This data set contains 170,653 songs released from 1921 to 2020 from Spotify. For the purpose of research, we have modified the original data [(check it here)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vatsalmavani/spotify-dataset/code) by renaming fields and adding identification and genre information. Typical features include:

- **Track Information:** Such as song ID, song name, and artist names. This would include metadata about the tracks.
- **Audio Features:** Data points like acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, liveness, loudness, speechiness, tempo, and valence, which are standard Spotify API audio features that describe the qualities of a track.
- **Popularity Metrics:** The dataset might include a popularity score for each track, which is a metric used by Spotify to determine how often tracks are played and how recent those plays are.
- **Temporal Data:** Information about the release date of each track and the year they were released.
- **Identification Data:** Unique identifiers for each song (song ID) and each artist (artist ID).
