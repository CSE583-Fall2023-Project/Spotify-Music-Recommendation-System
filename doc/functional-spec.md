## ðŸŽ¶ Background  

<p> 
<strong>Music is dynamic</strong> â€“ the history of music is the history of human culture; each era presents its own story through its distinct styles and genres.  <strong>Music is diverse</strong> â€“ each genre is characterized by its unique blends of composition elements, varying in rhythms, scales, harmonies, and structures.  <strong>Music tells us about ourselves.</strong>  Our music taste is shaped by our surroundings and exposures, by a mix of cultural influences, popular trends, and personal experiences.    
</p>
<p> 
In the dynamic and diverse world of music streaming and discovery, our project aims to offer a <strong>unique personalized and enriching experience that caters to the tastes of individual users</strong>.  At the core of this objective is the desire to not only provide music recommendations but to do so in a way that is insightful and resonates with each userâ€™s unique music journey.  
</p>
<p> 
The scope of this project emcompasses three major aspects.  First, we hope to <strong>inform the historical music insights</strong>, uncovering the story of music behind the data.  Leveraging the Spotify music dataset, we will discover and illustrate interesting patterns and trends through interactive visualization dashboards with customizable controls.   Second, we want to <strong>provide personalized recommendations</strong> based on user behavioral preferences and potentially social networks, improving listening experience through understanding then predicting the unique tastes of each user.  Ultimately, we want to create a platform where users can explore the rich history of contemporary music and discover new personal favorites, all within <strong>an engaging interactive user-friendly interface</strong>.  We aim to create a music discovery experience that is not only enjoyable but also insightful and personal.

## ðŸ“Š Data Source

### Spotify Dataset (Content Filtering)

This data set contains 170,653 songs released from 1921 to 2020 from Spotify. For the purpose of research, we have modified the original data [(check it here)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vatsalmavani/spotify-dataset/code) by renaming fields and adding identification and genre information. Typical features include:

- **Track Information:** Such as song ID, song name, and artist names. This would include metadata about the tracks.
- **Audio Features:** Data points like acousticness, danceability, energy, instrumentalness, liveness, loudness, speechiness, tempo, and valence, which are standard Spotify API audio features that describe the qualities of a track.
- **Popularity Metrics:** The dataset might include a popularity score for each track, which is a metric used by Spotify to determine how often tracks are played and how recent those plays are.
- **Temporal Data:** Information about the release date of each track and the year they were released.
- **Identification Data:** Unique identifiers for each song (song ID) and each artist (artist ID).
