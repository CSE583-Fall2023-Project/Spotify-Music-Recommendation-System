<br>

## ðŸŽ¶ Background

In the dynamic and diverse world of music streaming and discovery, our project aims to offer a **unique personalized and enriching experience that caters to the tastes of individual users**.  At the core of this objective is the desire to not only provide music recommendations but to do so in a way that is insightful and resonates with each userâ€™s unique music journey.  

The scope of this project emcompasses **three major aspects**ï¼š

**Inform Historical Music Insights**: uncovering the story of music behind the data. Leveraging the Spotify music dataset, we will discover and illustrate interesting patterns and trends through interactive visualization dashboards with customizable controls. 

**Provide Personalized Recommendations**: based on user behavioral preferences and potentially social networks, improving listening experience through understanding then predicting the unique tastes of each user.  

**Create engaging interactive user-friendly interface**: users can explore the rich history of contemporary music and discover new personal favorites through this *prototype app*. This tool is designed to create a music discovery experience that is not only entertaining but also informative and personalized.

## Data

This [**Spotify Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vatsalmavani/spotify-dataset/code) contains 170,653 songs released from 1921 to 2020 from Spotify. For the purpose of research, we have modified the original data  by renaming fields and adding identification and genre information. [Click here for more infomation](https://github.com/CSE583-Fall2023-Project/Spotify-Music-Recommendation-System/blob/main/doc/functional-spec.md). 


Original datasets include data for artists, genres, years, and Spotify data. The newly added dummy datasets include data for User-Songs, User-Friends, and User-Friends. All project data is stored as CSV files in the [data](https://github.com/CSE583-Fall2023-Project/Spotify-Music-Recommendation-System/tree/main/data) file.
